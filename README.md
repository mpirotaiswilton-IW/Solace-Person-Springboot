## Setup and Pre-requisites

1. If not already installed:

- Install the latest version of OpenJDK 17 on your device (The following page has a complete catalogue of OpenJDK downloads: [https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads))
- Install Docker on your device (you can use the following link for a guide: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

>If you are using Docker Desktop for Windows, make sure to use version **4.26.1** or lower. 
>
>The solution will not deploy with `docker-compose` if you are using version **4.27.1**. This is a known issue with this version of Docker Desktop for Windows.

2. Clone this repository or download the .zip file from GitHub (extract the downloaded zip file )

## Running the Microservice

1. Using a Command Line Interface of your choosing, change directory to the downloaded/cloned repository


2. To build both of our microservice, you will need to use the following command:  

```
<# Linux/MacOs #>
./mvnw clean package

<# Windows #>
.\mvnw clean package
```
* Change directory to `<Directory where Github repo is located>/Solace-Person-Springboot/person_publisher` and run the command above.

* Change directory to `<Directory where Github repo is located>/Solace-Person-Springboot/person_subscriber` and run the command above.

3. Once both builds are successful, run this command to deploy them along with an event broker:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

4. 6 docker containers should now be running:
    * `publisher-microservice`: where a spring-boot api image, built using a Dockerfile, is containerized. This container is responsible for sending events contaning personal information to the event broker.
    * `subscriber-microservice`: where a spring-boot api image, built using a Dockerfile, is containerized. This container is responsible for consuming events contaning personal information from the event broker to store them as entries into a database.
    * `db`: where a Postgres database is containerized and used by the `person-subscriber` application.
    * `pgadmin`: where a pgAdmin container is used to access the containerized Postgres database.
    * `solace`: where a Solace event broker is containerized.
    * `solace-init`: where a python script runs to set up our `solace` container with all the queues and subscribed topics needed for our microservices to communicate.

5. After a few minutes, `publisher-microservice` will have ran and exited, sending events to be consumed by `subscriber-microservice` and populated our database. You can verify the `publisher-microservice` container has exited by running the following command:
```
docker ps -f "name=publisher-microservice"
```

#### Cleaning up Exited Containers

At this point, there are 2 container which are no longer running: `solace-init` and `publisher-microservice`. These containers have ran to set-up our Solace event-broker and to send a batch of 1000 new people entries as events. To remove these exited containers, run the following command in a seperate CLI window: 
```
docker container prune -f
```
You can verify that 4 containers are running by using the following command in your CLI:
```
docker ps
```

## Verifying our Solution

When we deployed our microservices using docker-compose, `publisher-microservice` automatically sent 1000 entries of a mock data set (from the file [Mock_data.csv](https://github.com/mpirotaiswilton-IW/Solace-Person-Springboot/blob/main/person_publisher/src/main/resources/Mock_data.csv)) as events when the `solace-init` container had exited. From there, `subscriber-microservice` will be listening to those events, receiving the data and storing it into the `db` database. To verify our solution worked as intended, we will view the contents of the database.

### Viewing our Database using pgAdmin

Using a web browser of your choosing, head to <http://localhost:5050/>. You should see the pgAdmin login page. To verify both databases, make sure to sign in using the following credentials:

* Email : `admin@admin.com`
* Password : `admin`

You can change these credentials under the following `pgadmin` container environment variables in the "[docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/mpirotaiswilton-IW/Solace-Person-Springboot/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml)" file: 

* `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`
* `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`

After successfully logging into pgAdmin, click on `Add New Server` on the Dashboard Home Page:
1. In the General tab, name your server as you see fit
2. Navigate to the Connection tab
3. For the `host name/address`, use the name of the Postgres container `db`
4. Make sure the port field is `5432`
5. the `Username` field is defined by the `POSTGRES_USER` environment variable for the `db` container in the `docker-compose.yaml` file
6. the `Password` field is defined by the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable for the `db` container in the `docker-compose.yaml` file
7. Click save and, in the Object explorer, under Servers you should see your newly saved server `db`. This is the database `subscriber-microservice` uses.
8. In the Object Explorer, under `db > Databases` select `admin`
9. In pgAdmin menu bar, select `Tools > Query Tool`. This will load a new window with a blank page to write an SQL query to our database.
10. Run the following query in the query tool: 
```
SELECT * FROM people_table
```
11. This query should return exactly 1000 rows, you can verify that the list is accurate to the source data by comparing the result of the query to the csv file [Mock_data.csv](https://github.com/mpirotaiswilton-IW/Solace-Person-Springboot/blob/main/person_publisher/src/main/resources/Mock_data.csv)
